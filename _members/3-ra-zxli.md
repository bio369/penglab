Hi, I am a PhD student (Class of 2026) in Penglab. My research integrates spatial transcriptomics and lineage tracing technologies to map the spatiotemporal trajectories of the nervous system. I am particularly interested in decoding how distinct clonal lineages commit to developmental fates and how these lineages dynamically transition during pathological injury. By bridging molecular profiles with spatial architecture, my work aims to uncover the fundamental rules governing cellular plasticity and fate decisions in both healthy development and disease states.
