Hi! I am Chenkai Guo (郭臣凯), a third-year master student at PengLab at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Previously, I obtained B.S. in College of Life Sciences from South China Agricultural University (SCAU). My research interests focuses on developing AI/ML algorithms for single-cell and spatial omics. During my spare time, I enjoy playing billards and listening to EDM music.
