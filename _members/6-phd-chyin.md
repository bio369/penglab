Hello, I am chuanhui yin,a Ph.D. candidate in the Peng Lab, I graduated with a Master's inBiochemistry and Molecular Biology from Southern Medical University and joined the Peng Lab in 2023. I focus on the mechanism of tissue regeneration and repair. No matter macro or micro damage, the body will always start the repair process; Even the slightest repair reaction, once precisely intervened by drugs or Bioengineering means, may bring breakthrough therapeutic effects
