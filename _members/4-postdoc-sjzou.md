I am currently a Postdoc in Penglab, with research focus on development of multimodal spatial omic technologies. Previously I have received my Ph.D degree in CityU Hong Kong, in the area of micro devices for biosensing. As a nature lover, I spent a lot of my off-work time in hiking, kayaking, birding, or simply sitting on the river side to enjoy the wind.
