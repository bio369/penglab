Hi! I am Yu'ang Ma (马宇昂), a postdoctoral researcher at PengLab, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I completed my Ph.D. studies at the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB), CAS. My research focuses on the development of spatial multi-omics technologies, containing transcriptomics and epigenomics. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing tennis and table tennis to maintain work-life balance.
