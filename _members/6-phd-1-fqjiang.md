Hello, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Peng Lab, having joined in October 2019 after completing my Master’s degree at Jinan University. During my Master’s studies, I focused on investigating the mechanisms by which RNA m6A modifications regulate cardiac regeneration in mice. Since joining the Peng Lab, my research has been dedicated to developing spatial multi-omics technologies. Based on high-resolution microfluidic chip technology, I have contributed to the development of MISAR-seq (published in *Nature Methods*), a method that enables simultaneous profiling of spatial transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility on the same tissue section, as well as EPIC-map (currently under review), a technique designed for simultaneous detection of pharmacogenomic target engagement and histone modification sites. If you have any questions or topics of interest, please feel free to reach out via email at jiang_fuqing@gibh.ac.cn.
