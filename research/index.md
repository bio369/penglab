# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research integrates cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics, lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and organoid technologies. We are driven by the goal to map and model the functional and regulatory dynamics of cells within living systems—from embryos to adult tissues—and to translate these insights into novel strategies for tissue repair, organ reconstruction, and regenerative medicine.
